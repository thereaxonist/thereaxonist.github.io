        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>I'm The Reaxonist, and I've waited thirty years to be here. 
          Where is here? The intersection of mental alignment and freedom from the constraints of a standard American workday.
        I mashed my name up from different playdough colors:</p>
        <p>Axons are the neurons responsible for thought, and the purpose of this site is to share how I react to and process anything and everything I learn.</p>
        <p>The -ist makes me sound professional! Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you stick around!</p>
